Let's break down the Factory Method design pattern with a simple example in C#. The Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass,
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It's particularly useful when you don't know ahead of time what class objects you'll need.

Imagine we're creating a simple application that logs messages. We might have different types of loggers (e.g., a console logger, a file logger, etc.). Using the Factory Method, 
we can create a framework that allows for the expansion of logger types without modifying existing code.

Step 1: Define the Product Interface
First, we define an interface for the types of objects the factory method will create. This interface will be implemented by the concrete products.

public interface ILogger
{
    void Log(string message);
}


Step 2: Create Concrete Products
These are the specific implementations of the ILogger interface.

public class ConsoleLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("ConsoleLogger: " + message);
    }
}

public class FileLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log(string message)
    {
        // For simplicity, we're just printing out the message.
        // In a real application, you'd write the message to a file.
        Console.WriteLine("FileLogger: " + message);
    }
}



Step 3: Define the Creator Class
This abstract class declares the factory method, which returns an object of type ILogger. 
Subclasses of LoggerCreator will implement this method to create specific logger objects.

public abstract class LoggerCreator
{
    // The factory method
    public abstract ILogger CreateLogger();

    public void LogMessage(string message)
    {
        // Call the factory method to create a Logger object.
        var logger = CreateLogger();
        logger.Log(message);
    }
}


Step 4: Create Concrete Creators
These classes implement the factory method to create specific logger objects.

public class ConsoleLoggerCreator : LoggerCreator
{
    public override ILogger CreateLogger()
    {
        return new ConsoleLogger();
    }
}

public class FileLoggerCreator : LoggerCreator
{
    public override ILogger CreateLogger()
    {
        return new FileLogger();
    }
}


Step 5: Use the Factory Method
Finally, let's use the Factory Method in our application.

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        LoggerCreator loggerCreator;

        // Decide which logger to use
        loggerCreator = new ConsoleLoggerCreator();
        loggerCreator.LogMessage("This is a console log.");

        loggerCreator = new FileLoggerCreator();
        loggerCreator.LogMessage("This is a file log.");
    }
}
In this example, the LoggerCreator class defines the factory method CreateLogger, and the concrete creators (ConsoleLoggerCreator and FileLoggerCreator) implement this method to instantiate their respective products (ConsoleLogger and FileLogger). The main advantage here is that the Program class does not need to know which logger type it is using; 
it just knows it can log messages, allowing for flexibility and extensibility in the logging functionality.
